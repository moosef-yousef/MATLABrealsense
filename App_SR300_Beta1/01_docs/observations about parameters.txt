Calibration deactivates | enable auto exposure
			| enable auto white balance

With auto exposure = off
     auto white balance = off

SR300 starts really dark
F200 less so
OBS for SR300

blue tends to gree in the F200
SR300 has a reddish image

1. Change exposure
SR300	 - OPTION 2 has dramatic effects (very bright
4 ideal

1. backlight comp. = 5
it seems it doesn't do antyhng

2. brightness = 129


3. contrast = 101
VERY sensite. Cannot go elsewhere other than 
10 <= par <= 70

4. exposure = 9
beyond -4 is useless
test for -8 <= par <= -4

5. gain = 129
80 reproduces nice colors
changes only image brightness/contrast together, it seems
test:  40 <= par <= 100


6. gamma = 400
0 <= par <= 400

7. hue = 361
-10 <= par <= 10
8. saturation = 101 
50 <= par <= 68

9. sharpness = 101 (not necessary for color calibration
<= par <=

image looks sharper obviously. But not that obvious, it's sharper 
in a good way, without lots of artifacts.


10. white balance = 3700
changes colors dramatically
3300 <= par <= 3900
anything else is useless

auto exposure = on or off
auto white balance = on or off

1/(sqrt(6-2^2))

OBS FOR F200

color backlight compensation
-cant adjust the backlight in between integers

color brightness
-works well between full range

color contrast 
-works well between full range

color exposure
-works well between full range
-cant adjust the backlight in between integers
-has too drastic changes between numbers

color gain
-seems  to do the same thing as color exposure but a bit more sensitive through the range

color gamma
-seems to change the colors throughout the full range 

color hue
-extremely sensitive and nonsensical 

color saturation
-scale does not seem to make sense, however this parameter works well 

color sharpness
-does not work throughout the full range

color white balance
-the blue does not change between the range 3540-2800
-the red does not change between the range 6500-5390

color enable auto exposure
-too drastic of a change between the range
-cannot choose a number in between 0 and 1

color enable auto white balance
-there is a very subtle change between 0-1
-cannot choose a number in between 0 and 1
